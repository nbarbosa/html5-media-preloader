# HTML5 Media Preloader
A queue-based HTML5 media preloader for games & other media-heavy apps. It works for audio, images, and documents.

## How to use
	var preloader = new MediaPreloader({
	            inclusiveItems: [], // optional list of resources in the format "{ href: 'path_to_resource' }""
	    href: 'path/to/json/response', // response example: [{href: 'image1.jpg'}, .. {href:'audio1.mp3'}] - this is the list of resources to be loaded
	    fromRoot: 'path/to/root' // optional root to prepend to every href in response
	    updateCallback: function (percent) {
	      // callback to update a progress bar, for example
	    },
	    doneCallback: function (successCount, errorCount) {
	        if (errorCount > 0) {
	            console.info('Not all resources have been loaded.');
	        }
	        // what to do when complete?
	    },
	    error: function (error) {
	        console.log(error);
	        // what to do when an error occurs?
	    }
	});
